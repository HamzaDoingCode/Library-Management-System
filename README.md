# Library-Management-System
This basic Management System is developed in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
In the system, a Library object is created at the start of the program. During runtime, the application provides a menu-driven interface that allows the library manager to perform essential operations efficiently, such as managing books and members.
The project presents core OOP concepts, including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

Note: This project was developed instantly after learning OOP in Python, with the primary goal of strengthening conceptual understanding through hands-on practice.
